## Game rules

1. To start the game, user must type `>cric play` in the channel. By default, the user will get to bat first.  
2. You can enter **any number from 1 to 6**. At the same time, the system will also choose a random number anywhere from 1 to 6.  
3. If the **number matches with the number that system chose**, the user is **OUT**. In case it does not match, the runs will keep on adding to user's scoreboard.  
4. After **first innings**, the user will have to bowl. The rules mentioned as above apply for bowling also.  
5. Game will end if the **system gets out** or has **scored more runs than the user** (won the game).  
6. The user will get a maximum of **15 seconds** to give his/her input. Failing to do so will end the game.
